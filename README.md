# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The goal of this exercise was to create a visualization of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for investment purposes. The exercise required importing and cleaning data before processing it to fit unsupervised machine learning models. The grouping clusters were then plotted in a visualization.

The process consisted of four deliverables:
* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA (cleaning the data, removing unnecessary rows, scaling the data)
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA (applying PCA to reduce the data to three principal components)
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means (creating an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K and running the K-means algorithm to predict K clusters)
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results (visualizing the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components and creating a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies)

The code for these deliverables can be found in the crypto_clustering.ipynb file, and an image of the visualization deliverable can be found below:
